 Dictionary:
 you can do this by dictTemp[keys].append(value)
	for encode  self.dic[longUrl]=x and for decode you used iteritems() to search for the shortUrl and then returned longUrl. But this increased 
	complexity to O(N) for decode. You the above code you decresed the complexity to O(1) just by swapping key-pair values in encode.L353
